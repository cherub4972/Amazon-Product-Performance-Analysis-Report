Amazon Product Performance Analysis
## Introduction
  This report presents a comprehensive analysis of product performance data from an Amazon marketplace dataset. The primary aim is to uncover trends and patterns that can support better decision-making around pricing, inventory management, customer engagement, and revenue growth. The dataset contains detailed information on individual products, including actual price, discounted price, rating, number of reviews, and product categories. The insights derived from this analysis are intended to help sellers or platform managers refine their business strategy.

## Methodology
To perform this analysis, Microsoft Excel was used extensively. The process began with data cleaning — duplicates and empty values were removed, and calculated columns were created to derive meaningful metrics. These included discount percentage, potential revenue, and a custom scoring system that combined rating and number of reviews to rank products more accurately.
  Pivot tables were then used to summarize the data, identify category-level performance, and answer specific business questions. Slicers were added for interactivity on the dashboard. Finally, the dashboard sheet was developed to visualize key findings through KPI cards, bar charts, and dynamic filters.

## Key Findings and Analysis
First, the Fashion and Footwear categories consistently offered the highest discount percentages. This likely points to overstocking or a strategy to attract buyers through aggressive pricing. However, these categories didn’t perform as strongly in ratings or customer reviews, suggesting that heavy discounts may not always correlate with higher satisfaction or visibility.


In contrast, the Electronics category not only had the largest number of products but also generated the highest number of reviews and highest potential revenue. Products in this category generally enjoyed better ratings and engagement. This makes Electronics a high-performing segment and a strong candidate for further investment and targeted promotions.


An analysis of price ranges showed that most products were concentrated in the ₹200–₹500 range. Premium products priced above ₹500 were fewer, but often had better ratings — possibly due to better perceived quality. Most product ratings fell between 3.5 and 4.5, which is considered decent. However, a few products with extremely high ratings (4.8+) stood out and may be worth featuring more prominently.

Another critical observation came from comparing rating scores and discount percentages. Contrary to expectations, products with the highest discounts did not have the best ratings. This indicates that pricing strategy alone does not drive customer satisfaction — product quality and brand trust still play a central role.


One particularly insightful analysis focused on identifying the top 5 products by combining both ratings and the number of reviews. This method provided a more balanced view of product excellence by considering not just how well products were rated, but also how widely they were reviewed.


Finally, over 70% of all listed products had fewer than 1,000 reviews, which points to either newer listings or products that lack visibility. These products may benefit from increased exposure through ads or bundling strategies.

## Interpretation

The findings suggest a significant imbalance between discount strategies and actual product performance. While categories like Fashion depend heavily on discounts, they lag in customer engagement and satisfaction. On the other hand, categories like Electronics strike a better balance between pricing, product quality, and user engagement.
The review count plays a critical role in building trust with customers. Products with high ratings but few reviews may be high-potential items that are simply not being discovered. These should be brought into focus through marketing initiatives.
Additionally, discounting should be approached carefully. While discounts may drive clicks, they do not guarantee satisfaction or repeat purchases. It is clear that customer satisfaction depends more on product value and quality than just price.

## Challenges Encountered During the analysis 
One of the biggest issues was the absence of a date field in the dataset. This made it impossible to track trends over time or use timeline filters. Additionally, some calculated fields such as potential revenue and discount percentage did not immediately appear in pivot tables. Refreshing data connections and reloading fields became necessary.

Another challenge came from long category names, which made it difficult to maintain a clean layout in the dashboard visuals. This required shortening category names or adjusting column widths frequently.

There were also issues with slicer and chart connections. Moving charts between sheets broke some pivot table links, which had to be rebuilt. Lastly, inconsistencies in data (such as missing prices or review counts) had to be manually addressed during cleaning.

## Recommendations

# 1. Promote High-Quality Low-Visibility Products
Identify products with strong ratings but few reviews, and feature them in newsletters, ads, or influencer campaigns to boost awareness.
# 2. Reevaluate Deep Discounting Practices
Categories with frequent discounts but low ratings should be audited for product quality and vendor reliability. Over-discounting may reduce brand trust.
# 3. Invest in High-Revenue Categories
Electronics and Home Decor are showing strong revenue potential and should be the focus of cross-selling and promotional activities.
# 4. Encourage Customer Feedback
Implement incentives or reminders to encourage more customer reviews for underperforming listings to build credibility.
# 5. Use Data-Driven Category Strategies
For instance, Fashion might need a style refresh or brand update, while Home products may need a push toward higher price tiers.


## Conclusion
This analysis has revealed crucial patterns in product performance across the Amazon platform. It highlights the importance of balancing pricing with product quality, visibility, and customer feedback. The insights from this report, paired with an interactive dashboard, offer a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making.


Moving forward, stakeholders are encouraged to revisit their pricing models, invest in high-potential products, and align marketing strategies with data insights. With consistent tracking and improvement based on the dashboard, Amazon sellers can better respond to market trends and customer preferences.
